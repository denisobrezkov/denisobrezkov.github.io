My name is Denis Obrezkov and I am a researcher in the field of knowledge
management. I am interested in the following areas:

- personal information management
- knowledge management
- cognitive science
- human-computer interaction
- usable security.

In my research, I aim to apply experimental methods to tackle problems in
knowledge management. Additionally, I aim to formulate new theories that will enable us to
design more effective human-information interactions.
